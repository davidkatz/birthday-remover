This simple AppleScript iterates over your OS X Address Book. For each contact, it asks you if you want to 'Keep' or 'Remove' that contact's birthday. 


WHY
---

On my iPhone, all my contact's birthdays got scheduled as all day events. This was particularly annoying when I used Siri. Half the time I tried to schedule something, I got back a 'Note that you already have X conflicting events at that time'. Then, when I checked, it turned out to be some dude's birthday.

This script let me put in a few minutes to decide which birthdays I want to keep in my calendar.

Now I'm back to Sirin' happily.
